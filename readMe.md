# CompactRE
CompactRE is a single stop reverse engineering tool. The idea is to incorporate many utilities in a single stop. It is written to work on all platforms alike.
The way how it is written can be seen in modular form as follows:
* In the First phase, utilities thaat help to find the characteristics of a file are used. This helps in finding initial properties of the file supplied
* In the Second Phase, dependencies used by the file is found out.
* More to be added soon....

## Who is the user?
Anyone who wants to gain information about the object file or executable file, but does not like going after all the utilities, but is in need of a one stop solution.

## How to use?
Download the source file, and run with python3.6 or later. Run the main file **compactRE.py -h** which will print the help message.

## Developement
This is not a disasssembly tool, neither do I intend to implement any tool from my side. I try to incorporate any utility that is available in Linux or Windows or MAC in this suite and try to sort any useful information that can be gained from using those tools. Please use Cygwin inside windows. This is because windows does not support **fork** command. Developement is going on...

Please write to me if you want to help or shoot any suggestion..
